# 💫 About Me:
I have practical experience with SIEM monitoring, log analysis, malware analysis (basic), and file integrity monitoring, gained through academic projects and self-driven labs. I’ve worked with tools such as Wazuh, Kali Linux, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and virtualized lab environments to simulate real-world security scenarios.<br><br>I’m currently building my foundation for SOC L0/L1 roles, focusing on alert analysis, incident triage, vulnerability awareness, and clear documentation. Alongside technical skills, I value structured learning, consistency, and clear communication, which I also practice through technical writing and blogging on cybersecurity topics.<br><br>I’m always eager to learn, improve my skills, and collaborate on security-focused projects. My goal is to grow into a cybersecurity professional who can effectively contribute to security monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement of defensive systems.<br><br>
